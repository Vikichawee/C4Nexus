Technologies Used:

React: The front-end of the application was built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Material-UI: Material-UI components were integrated to enhance the visual design and interactivity of the application.
Custom CSS: Custom CSS styles were employed to tailor the appearance and layout of components according to the requirements.
Implemented Changes:

Filter Component: A Filter component was introduced to enable users to apply filters based on color, minimum price, and maximum price. This component was built using Material-UI's FilledInput and Button components.

ProductTile Component: The ProductTile component was enhanced to display product details using Material-UI's Card components. Images, product names, descriptions, and prices were formatted using Typography components.

Sorting Menu: A sorting functionality was added to allow users to sort the displayed products by ascending or descending price. This was achieved by incorporating a Material-UI Menu with sorting options.

Responsive Design: The entire application was made responsive by using media queries to adapt the layout and styling based on different screen sizes. Three breakpoints were defined for small, medium, and large screens.

Challenges Faced:

Responsive Design: Adapting the application's layout and styles for different screen sizes was challenging, particularly ensuring that components are appropriately positioned and spaced while maintaining a consistent appearance across devices.
Menu Integration: Integrating the sorting menu using Material-UI's Menu component required careful handling of state management and anchor positioning to ensure smooth functionality.
CSS Styling: Coordinating custom CSS with Material-UI's components to achieve a cohesive and visually appealing design was a challenge, especially in situations where the default styles conflicted with the desired design.

In conclusion, the task involved leveraging React and Material-UI to improve the user experience and aesthetics of the web application. Key enhancements included the Filter component, refined ProductTile design, sorting functionality, and responsive design. While challenges related to responsive layout, menu integration, and CSS styling were encountered, they were successfully addressed to deliver a polished and functional user interface.
